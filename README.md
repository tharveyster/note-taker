## Description
This project is a note taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves, retrieves, and deletes note data from a JSON file.

When the user Clicks in the Note Title area they can enter a new note title. They can then click in the note text area and type the content of their note. Once you click the <img src="./public/assets/images/save-solid.svg" width=15> button, the note is added to the JSON file and appears in the list to the left. Clicking on a note title in the left column opens the note on the right. Notes can also be deleted by clicking the <img src="./public/assets/images/trash-alt-solid.svg" width=15> button. If a note is open on the right side, clicking the <img src="./public/assets/images/plus-solid.svg" width=15> button will clear the fields and allow a new note to be typed.
